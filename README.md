# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project-on-Player-Injury-Rate-in-English-Premiere-League-Using-Table
The project deals with the data from the English Premier league (A major league soccer tournament) and it contains data from the year 2003 through to the year 2015.
Description of the dataset:
The data source is an Excel file which has the injury stats of all the players of the team participating in the premier league. The source data contains around 9400 instances and nine fields or variables. These variables are used find the winning probability and the effect of injuries on the winning probability.
The different fields available in the data are:
1. Date: This field gives the date when the event occurred.
2. Injury: This field gives the part of the body that was affected during the injury.
3. Injury (group): This gives the region of the body that of the injured part.
4. Player: The name of the player injured.

6. Team: The team to which they belong to is given in this field.
7. Number of records: This field gives the number of injuries recorded.
8. Winner: This gives the winner of the match affected by injuries.
Preparation of the data:
The cleaning of the data was done in Tableau. The dataset was downloaded from the official sources. The columns and the rows were selected and set in the Tableau environment.
Choice of Graphs and Findings:
We focus on the fact that the team with high injury rate has lesser title winning probability.
We have taken the team “Arsenal Football Club” into consideration as it is the team with highest injury rate and has the most types of injuries suffered by team players. The visualization depicts how the number of injuries affects the team performance.

Conclusion:
• Average injuries occurred per team is greater with Arsenal FC.
• Except for the year 2012, Arsenal FC has more injuries every season than Manchester United FC. This may be a reason for their failure to capture the league title.
• Bar graph in image 3 shows hamstring injury as the highest reason for the casualties.
• Chart 4 shows that Manchester United FC is the most successful team from the year 2003-2004 with most of the league titles.
